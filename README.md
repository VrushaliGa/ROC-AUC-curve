# ROC-AUC-curve and LDA/QDA 
Regrassion model 
* Create a logistic regression model with an associated ROC/AUC curve for predicting the type of raisin using Python and the Jupyter notebook. (i.e., Class). Additionally, make the logistic regression model's corresponding learning curve.  
* Create LDA and QDA models in Python using a Jupyter notebook to forecast the type of raisin (i.e., Class), but first use SMOTE to make sure the dataset is balanced. Additionally, make the dataset's Pandas Profile Report.
